# Sign And Login Page
Please note that the login verification in this app is in no way how verification would work for a fully deployed app, as it is only mock verification used for locally hosted versions of this project. The app uses only front end development techniques, so no security measures are implemented.

Please note as well that at this time there is not working account creation or storage at this time and account verrifcation is done for testing purposes. The test account credentials can be found in LoginPage.jsx.
